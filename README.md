# Facial Identification 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Facial Identification Project using OpenCV and a facial identification library. This project is designed to recognize faces in images and video streams. By running the `main_video.py` file, you can initiate the facial identification process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV
- Facial Identification Library (Please refer to the documentation for installation instructions)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yash-jain-1/Facial-Identification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd facial-identification-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install face_recognition
   ```

4. Follow the documentation for the facial identification library to complete the installation.

## Usage

1. Add images to the `images` folder that you want the system to recognize.

2. Run the `main_video.py` file:

   ```bash
   python main_video.py
   ```

3. The system will process the video stream and attempt to identify faces based on the images in the `images` folder.
